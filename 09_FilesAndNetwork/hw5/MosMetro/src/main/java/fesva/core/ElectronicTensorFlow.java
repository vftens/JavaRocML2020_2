OpenAI API Waitlist
        We're offering free access to the API through mid-August for our private beta, while we determine our longer-term pricing. Describe your use case or product below to join the waitlist.

        We’re also kicking off an academic access program to let researchers build and experiment with the API. We're going to start with an initial set of academic researchers and collaborators who will gain free access to the API.
        Обязательно
        1.What kind of access are you interested in?
        I am interested in being a beta user of the API
        I am interested in conducting academic research on the API
        I am interested in receiving email updates about the API
        2.Name
        Vitaly
        3.Email address
        aico@ya.ru
4.Name of your institution (if applicable)
        Saint-Petersburg State University
        5.Research area: We’re initially scoping our research collaborations to the following areas, though we welcome suggestions for areas of focus in the future. The questions for each area are illustrative - we’d be delighted to receive research proposals that answer different questions.
        Fairness and Representation: How should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation? How can responsive systems be established to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployed contexts?
        Robustness: Generative models have uneven capability surfaces, with the potential for surprisingly strong and surprisingly weak areas of capability. How robust are large language models to “natural” perturbations in text, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with/without typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large language models are more likely to be robust (or not robust), and how does this relate to the training data? How do robustness and fine-tuning interrelate? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g. across variations in prompts)?
        Model Exploration: Models like those served by the API have a variety of capabilities which we are yet to explore. We're excited by investigations in many areas including linguistic properties, commonsense or grounded reasoning, and potential uses for many other NLP problems (especially those involving generation).
        Interdisciplinary Research: How does AI intersect with other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, and sociolinguistics? We’re interested in exploring if and how general technologies like the API can be a tool to support research that engages with fields beyond AI.
        Misuses Potential: How can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of ‘red teaming’ approaches can we develop to help us and other AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies like this? Is it helpful to build prototypes of malicious systems to help us understand the threat landscape?

        6.Within the research area selected above, please describe the type of work you plan on doing with the API and your approach.
        I'll try via https://github.com/shreyashankar/gpt3-sandbox to add capabilities of mein RocAlphaGo solution  choosing the best result via some function to achive long work on matrix of Design and Construction, I thought.
        7.What is the anticipated timeline for completing this research (i.e. 3 months, 6 months)?
        6 months
        8.Would you be the sole investigator on this project, or would you require technical access for multiple individuals? If so, please specify how many.
        via Academician Skvortsov G.E. He knows, I think. Not many, academician is rather old. On first stage I'm the only one.
        9.What past research by you would you like us to read as we consider your submission (if applicable)?
        Translation from Python 2 to Python 3 of RocAlphaGo - from Rochester University, Open source solution for AlphaGo problem of AI. See https://github.com/vftens/RocAlphaGo/tree/aug25-keras2-py35
        10.Any other comments?
        Введите ответ
        I'll try to do research in combining the Java and Python connected in ML
