 Год выхода: 2021 
 Категория: Бизнес / Финансы и оценки 
 Описание: Predictions for the Tensorflow 2.0 are all based on a metric that is designed to cover domestic consumption and investment of private Robotics, to make it easier to use, 
how it is constructed - firstly as the usual market forecast, and then follows as the structure of the stock market.  
The Author with most of the standard input, and the author with more and more input, will advise on how the authors can push aggregators toward a better profitability 
that will make it easier to grow and make transition from money liquidation to money grow. 

**** Plan for implementing the working solution in rather fast robot:
1) Implementing Iron Python
2) Adding "Stock Market Prediction"
3) Programming Williams Robot with Prediction
4) Trying to use on Crypto borse with simple Robot
5) Implementing more complex with CNN
6) Next steps for adding and programming the Robot

2.1) Connecting the Data Source from internet with thinking process of Robot
2.2) Adding output of Prediction with deciding element
